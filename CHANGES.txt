0.9.2 (2011-02-20)
------------------

- Stop depending on ``pyramid.config.Configurator.with_context``.  Moved
  logic into this package in Pyramid 1.3a9+.

- Respect Pyramid 1.3a9+ ``introspection`` Configurator attribute.

0.9.1 (2011-12-14)
------------------

- Readd mistakenly removed ``paste.paster_create_template`` entry point.

0.9 (2011-12-14)
----------------

- Drop dependency on PasteScript (Pyramid 1.3 compat).

- Rename "paster_templates" dir to "scaffolds".

- Make scaffold compatible with Pyramid 1.3a2+ (use wsgiref).

- Drop scaffolding dependency on WebError.

- Scaffold now uses ``pyramid#wsgiref`` server instead of ``paste#http``
  server.  This will require the use of Pyramid 1.0.2, 1.1.3, 1.2.5, or
  1.3a2+.

0.8 (2011-12-06)
----------------

- Pyramid 1.3 compatibility.

- Depend on ``zope.configuration``>=3.8.0dev in order to prevent
  misconfigurations involving this package and older versions of
  zope.configuration.  z.config 3.8.0 uses dictionary-based actions (older
  versions used tuple-based actions).  Older versions of z.config will mostly
  appear to work with this version of pyramid_zcml, except for cases of ZCML
  which uses the includeOverrides directive; to avoid any confusion caused by
  this, we upward-pin to 3.8.0dev+.

  Note that Pyramid 1.0.X, 1.1.X, 1.2.4+ and 1.3 will all still work with the
  combination of pyramid_zcml 0.8 + zope.configuration 3.8.0.

0.7 (2011-10-07)
----------------

- The ZCML includeOverrides directive did not work properly when
  ``pyramid_zcml`` 0.6 was used with Pyramid 1.2.  Symptom: inappropriate
  ``ConfigurationConflictError`` errors.  See the discussion at
  http://groups.google.com/group/pylons-devel/browse_thread/thread/e9720c67b8388843?hl=en
  for more information.

0.6 (2011-09-04)
----------------

- Fix to work under Pyramid 1.2a4 and better.

- Depend explicitly on zope.configuration (upcoming releases of Pyramid will
  not).

- Use our a local PyramidConfigurationMachine when collecting ZCML actions,
  and splice the locally collected actions onto the configurator context's
  actions when ZCML processing is done.  This provides Pyramid the freedom to
  not rely on zope.configuration in the future, and somewhat futureproofs
  ``pyramid_zcml`` from changes to action processing in Pyramid.

0.5 (2011-08-24)
----------------

- Compatible with Pyramid 1.2a1.

0.4 (2011-08-17)
----------------

- Fix a unit test failure when used with Venusian 0.9.

- Compatible with Pyramid 1.2dev+.

0.3 (2011-07-22)
----------------

- Add tox.ini for testing.

- Pyramid 1.1 test suite fixes.

0.2 (2011-02-22)
-----------------

- Add ``wild_domain`` argument to authtkauthpolicy directive.

- Depend on ``pyramid>=1.0b1`` (``wild_domain`` argument to authtktauthpolicy
  directive).

- Make tests pass on Pyramid 1.0; squash testing deprecation warnings.

0.1 (unknown)
-------------

- Initial release, all ZCML directives broken out of Pyramid core.
